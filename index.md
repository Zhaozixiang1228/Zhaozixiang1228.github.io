My name is **Zixiang Zhao**. I am currently a second year MPhil student at [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://www.xjtu.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Jiangshe Zhang](http://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/jszhang). 

I obtained my Bachelor's degree from [Northwest University](http://www.nwu.edu.cn/) in China. My current research interests are in **computer vision** and **image fusion**. 

I am expected to obtain my Master's degree in 2021 and purse **an admission of a PhD program** in the area of deep learning and computer vision.

# RESEARCH PROJECT

1.***Efficient and Interpretable Infrared and Visible Image Fusion Via Algorithm Unrolling.***

* **Zixiang Zhao**, Shuang Xu, Chunxia Zhang, Junmin Liu, Jiangshe Zhang
* Submitted to ECCV 2020                                                  
* Presented an algorithm unrolling based interpretable deep image decomposition network for infrared and visible image fusion


2.***DIDFuse: Deep Image Decomposition for Infrared and Visible Image Fusion. Zixiang Zhao, Jiangshe Zhang et al.***

***Zixiang Zhao**, Shuang Xu, Chunxia Zhang, Junmin Liu, Jiangshe Zhang*

-Submitted to IJCAI 2020 

-Proposed a data-driven auto-encoder based network to accomplish the two-scale decomposition for image fusion


3.***Bayesian Fusion for Infrared and Visible Images. Zixiang Zhao, Jiangshe Zhang et al. ***

***Zixiang Zhao**, Shuang Xu, Chunxia Zhang, Junmin Liu, Jiangshe Zhang*

-Submitted to Signal Processing (IF2019: 4.086)     

-Established a Bayesian fusion model with a hierarchical Bayesian manner and the total-variation penalty, which can be inferred by the EM algorithm
