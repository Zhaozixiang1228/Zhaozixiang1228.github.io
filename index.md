My name is **Zixiang Zhao**. I am currently a second year MPhil student at [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://www.xjtu.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Jiangshe Zhang](http://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/jszhang). 

I obtained my Bachelor's degree from [Northwest University](http://www.nwu.edu.cn/) in China. My current research interests are in **computer vision** and **image fusion**. 

I am expected to obtain my Master's degree in 2021 and purse **an admission of a PhD program** in the area of deep learning and computer vision.
